		<h3>What are Doges?</h3>
		<p>Doge is a slang term for “dog” that is primarily associated with pictures of Shiba Inus (nicknamed “Shibe”) and internal monologue captions on Tumblr.</p>
		<h3>Origin of Doges</h3>
		<p>The use of the misspelled word “doge” to refer to a dog dates back to June 24th, 2005, when it was mentioned in an episode of Homestar Runner’s puppet show. In the episode titled “Biz Cas Fri 1”, Homestar calls Strong Bad his “d-o-g-e” while trying to distract him from his work.</p>
