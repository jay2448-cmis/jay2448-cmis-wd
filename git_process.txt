First, open up an application called "Terminal"
In order to clone your repasitory, type "git clone --config="http.proxy=http://username:userpassword@192.168.2.1:8080" https://github.com/username/repasitoryname" in terminal and press enter. You need to fill up the username and password with your own account. Same for the username and repasitory name.
You can't use ctrl+v on terminal, but you can use shift+insert
After that, you need to type "ls" to see the files you have. You need to see a folder named the same as your repasitory. If you don't, go back to step 2.
Type "cd your repasitory name" to open your repasitory in terminal. For your convenience, your can type the first 1~3 letters of your repo*(now i will call repository repo) name and press tab. Terminal will automatically find the file for you.*i believe that you will type your repo name after cd
In order to make or open a text file, type "gedit yourfilename" you need to change "yourfilename" to the name you want to call your file.For opening existing file you need to type the name of the file instead of "yourfilename"
After you make/open a file, you need to save the file(Ctrl+S)
After saving it, now you need to add, and push the file you made.
type "git add yourfilename" then it will add the file in your computer.
Type "git status" to see if your file has added to the computer
type "git push yourfilename" in order to push your file to the github server, you will need to log in with your github id
Now you are done! Turn off your computer and go sleep or something
